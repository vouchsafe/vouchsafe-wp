Add age verification and identity checks to your WordPress site with Vouchsafe. UK Online Safety Act–oriented, privacy-first, and simple to setup.

== Description ==

Vouchsafe helps you verify users quickly and inclusively, from simple age checks to full KYC/AML.

This plugin connects your WordPress site to your Vouchsafe team, so you can send your users to verify themselves and manage the results without leaving the WordPress dashboard.

If you provide user-to-user or adult content, you may need proportionate age assurance under the UK Online Safety Act. Vouchsafe offers age verification flows that can help you meet those duties while minimising friction.

- **Do everything from WordPress:** once set up, you never have to leave your familiar WordPress dashboard

== Features ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this compliant with the UK Online Safety Act? =
Vouchsafe provides **age verification flows** that can help you meet duties under the Act.

This plugin lets you trigger strong age checks and monitor the results without leaving your WordPress site, but full compliance depends on how you implement age assurance in your service and your risk profile.

= Can I gate pages or products based on age right now? =
This initial release focuses on triggering checks and monitoring the results. Front-end age gates and checkout enforcement will be added in future releases.

= Can I use this for Right to Work / Right to Rent / KYC/AML checks? =
Yes. Vouchsafe supports flows commonly used for Right to Work, Right to Rent, and KYC/AML.

This plugin helps you trigger checks and review recent results. Any front-end process (e.g., collecting documents) is handled via Vouchsafe’s flows and your site integration.

= Does the plugin store personal data in WordPress? =
Only your API credentials are stored in WordPress.

Verification data is fetched from Vouchsafe's GDPR-compliant data store, and the plugin does not store any personal information on your site.

= What does it cost? =
You can try all Vouchsafe features for free. After your first five verifications, you can continue to use it with no minimum commitment on our **Pay as you go** plan from only 99p per check.
